### Comments
> *Input Validation* - I made use of the try catch feature and I really liked it. I had never used a feature like that in code before. I feel like it makes cleaner code than just the program terminating if it can't figure convert an string to an integer. I also made a "GetProperString" and "GetProperNumber" method that I implemented in each challange to require any string to at least have one character. 

> *Challange 6* - For challange 6 I struggled through it but I have a much better understanind of ineritance and also interfaces now because of it. I think there's parts of it that could have been simplified but I at least get a MVP that works and functions all the way through. 

### Contributing
I'm sure everyone is dying to contribute to these projects but I don't want to be dismissed for plagerism so once I've got my grade I can open it for contributions.

### Dedication
I'd like to dedicate this project to my 3rd grade goldfish, Burger.
