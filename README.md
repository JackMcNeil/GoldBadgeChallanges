### Jack McNeil

#### Challanges

- **Challange 1** - Cafe

- **Challange 3** - Badges
- **Challange 4** - Company Outings

>All of the Challanges should run upon clone and should run all the way through. Or at least they did when I went through them all. 

### Comments

> *Challange 6* - For challange 6 I struggled through it but I have a much better understanind of ineritance and also interfaces now because of it. I think there's parts of it that could have been simplified but I at least get a MVP that works and functions all the way through. 

> *Challange 7* - I did not have time to finsih challange 7. I thought it would be fun to try to make a minimum viable product as fast as possible. That is what challange 7 is supposed to be so if the code isn't great or answers the prompt thats why. 

### Contributing
I'm sure everyone is dying to contribute to these projects but I don't want to be dismissed for plagerism so once I've got my grade I can open it for contributions.

### Dedication
I'd like to dedicate this project to my 3rd grade goldfish, Burger.
